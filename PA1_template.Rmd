## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{R}
data = read.csv('activity.csv')
head(data)
tail(data)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

# XXXX: Restart this - gasp! - actually using the dates provided in
#   the data.

Note that each day consists of approximately

XXXX: Name this and reuse it.

```{R}
24 * 60 * 60
```

seconds (i.e., the total number of hours in a day, converted to
seconds).

Since samples were taken every 5 seconds, we'll assume that each
"day" of observations consists of at most

```{R}
24 * 60 * 60 / 5
```

samples.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
