## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{R}
data = read.csv('activity.csv')
head(data)
tail(data)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Per the assignment instructions, we will for now (naively) limit our analysis for this
problem to non-missing values:

```{R}
print(nrow(data))
print(sum(is.na(data$steps)))
cleaned <- data[!is.na(data$steps),]
print(nrow(cleaned))
print(sum(is.na(cleaned$steps)))
```

Find the total number of steps per day, excluding missing values:

```{R}
by_date <- split(cleaned, cleaned$date)
total_steps_per_day <- sapply(by_date, function (date) { sum(date$steps) })
```

Histogram of total steps per day:

```{R}
hist(total_steps_per_day)
```

We can then calculate the mean and median number of steps taken per day as follows:

```{R}
mean(total_steps_per_day)
median(total_steps_per_day)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?

To find the average number of steps per 5-minute interval across all days, we split the
cleaned dataset (i.e., still ignoring NAs) across the interval numbers:

```{R}
by_interval = split(cleaned, cleaned$interval)
averages <- sapply(by_interval, function (interval) { mean(interval$steps) })
plot(x = names(averages),
     y = averages,
     type = 'l',
     xlab='Time of day',
     ylab='Average steps taken')
```


## Imputing missing values

An interesting question to ask up front is how to deal with the issue of missing values in our data.

The assignment instructs that, "For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset."  However, it's probably wise to get an initial sense of exactly how frequent these missing values were and how they are distributed throughout the dataset:  a day which consists strictly of NA values could probably be ignored entirely from our analysis, whereas a day which requires a mix of NA and non-NA values might or might not be useful for our analysis depending on the percentage of values missing.


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
