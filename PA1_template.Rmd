## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{R}
data = read.csv('activity.csv')
head(data)
tail(data)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Per the assignment instructions, we will limit our analysis for this problem to
non-missing values:

```{R}
print(nrow(data))
print(sum(is.na(data$steps)))
cleaned <- data[!is.na(data$steps),]
print(nrow(cleaned))
print(sum(is.na(cleaned$steps)))
```


```{R}
by_date <- split(data, data$date)
```




## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
